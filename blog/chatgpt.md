Hey builders 👋  

If you want to power your app with AI, this guide will walk you through a few simple steps to integrate ChatGPT into your Nowa project and get your app talking in no time.

## Why Add ChatGPT to Your App?

Imagine your app could *chat* with users, answer questions, or even write content — automatically. That’s exactly what ChatGPT makes possible.  

By connecting OpenAI’s ChatGPT API to your Nowa project, you unlock powerful AI features without having to learn complex programming.  

Nowa’s **AI-assisted builder** makes this even easier: you can just tell Nowa what you want, and it will help you connect your app screen to the API in minutes.

## Step 1: Set Up Your OpenAI Account

Before connecting ChatGPT to your app, you’ll need an OpenAI account.  

👉 Head over to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) and sign up (or log in if you already have one).  

Once you’re in, you’ll find your personal dashboard where everything starts.

## Step 2: Create Your ChatGPT API Key

This is your app’s “access pass” to ChatGPT — it tells OpenAI that your app has permission to use the AI.  

Here’s how to generate one:

1. Go to the **Dashboard**.  
2. Click on **API keys** in the left sidebar.

3. Hit the **+ Create new secret key** button.

You’ll be asked to name your key — something simple like “My Nowa ChatGPT Key” works great.  

:::tip
 If the button doesn’t work, you probably need to verify your phone number first.  
:::

Once created, **copy your key** and store it somewhere safe (like a password manager). Never share it publicly — it’s like your app’s personal login.

## Step 3: Add Billing to Activate Your Key

Your API key won’t work until you’ve added a payment method.  

Don’t worry — OpenAI only charges you for what you use. There’s no monthly fee or surprise charges.  

To set it up:
1. Click on your **profile icon**.  
2. Go to **Your profile → Billing**.

3. Add your credit or debit card details.

That’s it! Your API key is now live and ready to power your app.

## Step 4: Understand How the ChatGPT API Works

Every time your app talks to ChatGPT, it sends a message (Post Request) in a simple format called **JSON** (a structure that apps use to talk to each other).  

Along with this message, it also includes something called headers — these are small pieces of information sent before the main content that tell the server how to handle the request.

API Endpoint:

```URL
https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
```

Header
```json
Authorization: Bearer $Your-key
```

Here’s what it looks like:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
  ]
}
```

And here’s what ChatGPT sends back:

```json
{
  "choices": [{
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Hello there, how may I assist you today?"
    }
  }]
}
```

Pretty simple, right?  

You send a message → ChatGPT responds → Your app displays the answer.
