# The New Nowa AI Agent is Coming**

![Nowa AI Agent V2](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQE_kGx9c98n9g/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZZ3P_BbHYAo-/0/1745757404096?e=1753920000&v=beta&t=y-XmhuW5uUJ2o4LRLdI1df1Eu7J6RWDP4kWy0ZMrGBQ)

Hey builders 👋

We wanted to give you a quick behind-the-scenes update on what we’ve been working on at Nowa.

<!-- truncate -->


We recently started testing a smarter AI assistant that helps you build apps from start to finish. It doesn’t just generate — it can **edit**, **fix errors**, and **improve** your app too. We’ve made sure it creates **great-looking UIs** and offers **smart UX ideas** right out of the box, so your app is more likely to be loved by users.

Here’s a quick video of it building an app called **Weatherwise** in under 4 minutes:

The app gives smart tips about what to wear, use sunscreen, and best times to go out — all powered by a free weather API + OpenAI.

### From Assistant to Agent

At first, the AI needed you to tell it what parts of your project to look at. But that got confusing as projects grew. So we decided to take things to the next level.

We’re now building **V2: the Nowa AI Agent** — and it’s a whole new experience.

Here’s what it can do:

* 🧠 Understand your full project on its own
* 🔧 Spot bugs and fix them
* 🧩 Handle complex tasks
* 📄 Write docs and Play Store descriptions
* 📐 Suggest new features
* 🔌 Build and connect to Supabase or APIs
* 🎨 Improve screens, logic, and design

Here’s a video of it writing a full app description and even suggesting new features based on the target user:

### Want to Test It Early?

We’re getting ready to release the new agent to alpha testers in about **2 weeks**. After that, we’ll slowly open it up for everyone.

If you want to be part of the alpha, sign up here (it takes less than a minute):
👉 [https://forms.gle/iobXrCb7YEG3aC7UA](https://forms.gle/iobXrCb7YEG3aC7UA)

We’ll work closely with early testers to help them build and launch their apps. Since we’re keeping the group small, we might not accept everyone right away — but signing up puts you in line for faster access!

As always, if you have questions or need help, reach out on [Discord](https://nowa.dev/discord) or email us at **[team@nowa.dev](mailto:team@nowa.dev)**.

Let’s build something amazing together 🚀
