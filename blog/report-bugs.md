**Hey builders,**

Since we launched **Nowa 3.0**, many of you have already started exploring the power of the **AI agent** — some of you even built full apps just a few hours after launch. That’s beyond exciting!

We’re using a **premium AI model** that we’ve optimized and fine-tuned to generate **modern, stunning UIs**, **great UX**, **clean structure**, and **solid functionality** — it’s so powerful you can build a complete app in just 1–3 prompts.

But since Nowa is still in **BETA**, things may not always go perfectly — and that’s where we need your help.
