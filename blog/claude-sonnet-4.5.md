**Hey builders,**

When we launched Nowa 3.0, one of the biggest highlights was the **AI agent**.  
It could design beautiful UI, handle complex multi-screen flows, and write clean Flutter code — all at once.  

That didn’t happen by accident. We built a whole infrastructure around the agent to make sure it doesn’t just generate something “nice,” but instead gives you **production-ready results with clean, scalable Flutter code**. And for the past months, we’ve been running it on **Claude Sonnet 4**, one of the strongest coding models out there.  

Today, we’ve taken a big step forward:  
**Nowa AI is now powered by Claude Sonnet 4.5** — upgraded the same day it was released.  

So, what’s new — and what’s next? Let’s take a look.

## 🔥 Meet Claude Sonnet 4.5

Claude Sonnet 4.5 makes Nowa even sharper.  
Here’s what we’ve noticed right away:  

- **Better at complex tasks** → it now coordinates across multiple files and screens more smoothly, keeping things consistent across your whole project.  
- **More polished UI** → layouts come out cleaner, modern, and more visually compelling, without extra tweaking.

## ✨ What’s next for Nowa AI?

Upgrading to 4.5 is just the start. We’re already working on a bunch of improvements that will make using Nowa AI feel even more natural and fun:  

- **Streaming output** → instead of waiting for the results to drop at once part by part, you’ll see the response unfold live, which feels way better.  
- **Project-level prompts** → right now, it’s best to keep prompts focused on specific widgets or screens. Soon, you’ll be able to give bigger instructions, and Nowa will break them down into smaller steps automatically — making big features easier to build. Nowa will be able to break it down into tasks, while focusing on each task individually giving it it's full attention. This means bigger prompts will maintain same high quality 't results in a less quality results

- **Automatic bug fixing** → if the AI generated piece of code has a bug or more, the agent will catch and fix it on the spot, so you don’t have ask it to do so afterwards.  
- **Custom packages & code** → the AI will be able to pull in packages directly from pub.dev and write custom code, even if it’s not something built into Nowa yet.

## 💙 Final thought

We’re seeing incredible apps being built with Nowa 3.0 already — and every upgrade like this brings us closer to our mission: making Nowa the **fastest, most fun, and most powerful way to build production-ready Flutter apps**.  

And with Claude Sonnet 4.5 under the hood, the best is still ahead.  

Happy building! ✨
