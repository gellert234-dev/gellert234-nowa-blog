# Building a To-Do App with Supabase in Nowa 3.0

Hey builders! üëã  

It‚Äôs a great time to be building and launching apps ‚Äî especially with **Nowa 3.0** in your hands.  
This version is powered by our smartest AI agent yet, which can help you with everything from start to finish.

One of my favorite things about Nowa 3.0 is that it fully supports **Supabase**.  
And today, I‚Äôm going to walk you through building a **to-do app with login** ‚Äî all powered by Supabase on the backend and Nowa on the frontend.

We‚Äôll go step by step, and I‚Äôll show you how to:

- Set up Supabase with authentication and a secure table for your tasks.
- Connect Supabase to Nowa.
- Use AI to generate queries and UI.
- Make your app functional and ready to launch.

Let‚Äôs start with the backend setup.

---

## 1. Setting up Supabase

First, create a new project in Supabase.  

For our app, we just need one table to hold tasks. Each task will:

- Belong to a specific user.
- Store the time it was created.
- Have the task text itself.
- Have a boolean to mark it as complete or not.

Supabase already gives us an `auth` table for users, so we‚Äôll just add a `todos` table with these fields:

- `created_at` ‚Äì timestamp for when the task is created
- `user_id` ‚Äì foreign key linked to `auth.users.id`
- `task` ‚Äì the text of the task
- `is_complete` ‚Äì boolean for completion status

Since the table will hold **all users‚Äô tasks**, we need **Row Level Security (RLS)** so that users can only access their own data.

Here‚Äôs the SQL you can run in the Supabase SQL editor to set it all up:

```sql
-- Create the todos table
CREATE TABLE todos (
  id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
  task text NOT NULL,
  is_complete boolean DEFAULT false NOT NULL
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on the todos table
ALTER TABLE todos ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy to allow users to view their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own todos." ON todos
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create a policy to allow users to create their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own todos." ON todos
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create a policy to allow users to update their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own todos." ON todos
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create a policy to allow users to delete their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own todos." ON todos
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create a trigger to listen for changes on the todos table for real-time updates
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_todo()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NOTIFY todos_changes;
  RETURN new;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Set up the trigger to fire on INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
CREATE TRIGGER todo_changes_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON todos
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_todo();
```

## 2. Connecting Supabase to Nowa

Alright ‚Äî backend‚Äôs ready, so let‚Äôs jump into the fun part: the app itself. üöÄ

Here‚Äôs how to hook Supabase into your Nowa project:

1. Create a new project in Nowa.
2. In Supabase, copy your **URL** and **KEY**.
3. Back in Nowa, click the Supabase icon, paste those values, and hit **Connect**.

That‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre officially connected.

## 3. The default queries you get for free

The moment you connect, Nowa sets you up with three ready-to-use queries: **SignIn**, **SignUp**, and **SignOut**.

It also quietly adds a file called `supabase_service.dart` in the **integrations** folder.  
That file is your direct line to Supabase ‚Äî it‚Äôs where all the queries live and where the magic happens.

---

## 4. Testing those queries

Testing is easy:

- Select a query.
- Fill in any needed parameters.
- Click **Play** and watch your Supabase data change.

Here‚Äôs me testing the **SignUp** query by entering an email and password. The response you see is an `AuthResponse` ‚Äî don‚Äôt worry about the tech details, it just means the signup worked.  
Check your Supabase auth table, and boom ‚Äî the new user is there.

**Heads up:** Supabase will send a verification email. Make sure to click that link or you won‚Äôt be able to sign in.

## 5. Generating a query with AI

This is where Nowa‚Äôs AI agent really shines.

You can make queries in two ways:  
- Let AI do it for you.  
- Or paste the SQL/code yourself.

In the example below, I asked it to ‚Äúgenerate a query to add a task for a user‚Äù ‚Äî and it instantly created it, complete with the right query type. You don‚Äôt even need to tell it your table names or column types ‚Äî it already knows.

**One thing:** To test this ‚ÄúAdd Task‚Äù query, you‚Äôll need to be signed in first. More on that in a bit.

  <source src="/img/supabase/3.generate_query.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

## 6. Tweaking the query code

Want to peek under the hood?  
Click **Edit code** in the testing panel to see and tweak the query.  
You can also go straight to `supabase_service.dart` in the file panel and edit it there.

## 7. Signing in for testing

Some queries won‚Äôt work unless you‚Äôre logged in.  
Here‚Äôs the trick: just run the **SignIn** query. Once you do, you‚Äôll see ‚ÄúTesting as‚Ä¶‚Äù in the panel ‚Äî meaning every query that needs a user will use that account.

This is also handy if you want to test screens without starting from the login page every time.

Here‚Äôs how it looks:

## 8. Adding a task

Now that we‚Äôre signed in, let‚Äôs try the **Add Task** query.  
Run it, and in Supabase you‚Äôll see the new task with the exact `created_at`, `user_id`, and `is_complete` values.

  <source src="/img/supabase/5.TestQueryAddTask.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

---

## 9. Generating multiple queries in one go

Why stop at one query? You can ask the AI to make several at once.

In the example below, I told it to create queries for:
- Updating a task name  
- Marking a task as done  
- Deleting a task  

All from a single prompt.

  <source src="/img/supabase/6.generateManyQ.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

---

## 10. Testing an update query

Let‚Äôs test one ‚Äî updating a task name. I grabbed the task ID from earlier, typed in the new name, and ran it.  
Supabase updated instantly. ‚úÖ

## 11. Creating a login screen with AI

Time to bring the app to life.  

I opened the AI agent, attached the `SupabaseService` (so it has full context), and asked for a **login screen** using Supabase.  
It even threw in a home page for the to-do app ‚Äî both looking modern and clean right from the start.

  <source src="/img/supabase/8.MakeLogin.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

---

## 12. Making the home page functional

The home page was just a mockup, so I told the agent to make it functional using my Supabase queries ‚Äî add, edit, delete, mark as done.  
Since it already had the service file, it hooked everything up.

Playing the app now updates Supabase in real time.  
If you see a red error in the builder, just run the screen ‚Äî it needs real user data.

## 13. Final tips

- Click the three dots in the Supabase panel to see your tables, disconnect, or change keys.
- Already signed in? You can run any screen mid-flow without going through login.
- Give the AI plenty of context ‚Äî it‚Äôll save time and make your results even better.

And that‚Äôs it! üéâ  
You now have a fully working to-do app with using only **Nowa 3.0 + Supabase**.

If you end up building something cool with this setup, send it over to **team@nowa.dev** ‚Äî we love showing off what our builders are creating.

Next up, we‚Äôre talking **APIs**. Stay tuned.
